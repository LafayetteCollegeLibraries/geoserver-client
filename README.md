# RESTful Consumer for the GeoServer Web App. implemented using Guzzle

_Authored by griffinj [at] lafayette [dot] edu of the Lafayette College Libraries._

## The RESTful Client
This client was originally implemented to provide a more streamlined and modular interface for the integration between Islandora 7 core and the geoserver Module (within the Cartaro project).  Ideally, this will be of some utility to those outside of the Islandora community.

## The Islandora Community
The author also remains hopeful that this code base shall, at the very least, serve as a minimal prototype for emerging contributions within the Islandora community (within the context of developing and maintaining a community-supported solution for managing geospatial data sets within the Islandora ecosystem).

## Contributions
Contributions are, at this point, welcome from all parties, be they members of the Islandora, Cartaro, or Drupal communities (or, even, simply curious persons with some interest in involving themselves in this work).
