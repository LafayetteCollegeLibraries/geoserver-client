# RESTful Consumer in PHP for the GeoServer Web Appl. (implemented using Guzzle)

_Authored by griffinj [at] lafayette [dot] edu of the Lafayette College Libraries._

## The RESTful Client
This client was originally implemented to provide a more streamlined and modular interface for the integration between Islandora 7 core and the geoserver Module (within the Cartaro project).  Ideally, this will be of some utility to those outside of the Islandora community.

## The Cartaro and Islandora Communities
The author also remains hopeful that this code base shall, at the very least, serve as a minimal prototype for a potential contributions within the Cartaro community.  Further, as there has been interest voiced from within the Islandora community, this may also be of value to those looking towards developing a solution addressing the management of geospatial data sets within the Islandora ecosystem.

## Contributions
Contributions are, at this point, welcome from all parties, be they members of the Cartaro, Islandora, or Drupal communities (or, even, simply curious persons with some interest in involving themselves in this work).
